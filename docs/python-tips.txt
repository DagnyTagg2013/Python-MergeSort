""" NOTE:
The with statement handles opening and closing the file, including if an exception is raised in the inner block.
The for line in f treats the file object f as an iterable, which automatically uses buffered IO and memory management
so you don't have to worry about large files blowing up memory.

# PRIVATE METHODS and name-mangling (NO SUCH THING AS PRIVATE ACCESS RESTRICTION IN PYTHON)
# https://docs.python.org/2/tutorial/classes.html#private-variables-and-class-local-references
# essentially, private vars should be declared _pvtvar; or with a SINGLE leadint underscore
# essentially, private methods not to be exposed in public API through import have SINGLE leading underscore:  _pvtNotImported (or SINGLE leading underscore)
# essentially, private methods can be declared __pvtinitmethod; (or DOUBLE leading underscore, and is name_mangled by preprocessor to _classname__pvtinitmethod)
#              which protects classes on same inheritance hierarchy from confusing calling overrided method names from sublclasses.
